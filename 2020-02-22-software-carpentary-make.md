Make is a tool which can run commands to read files, process these files in some way, and write out the processed files. For example, in software development, Make is used to compile source code into executable programs or libraries, but Make can also be used to:

run analysis scripts on raw data files to get data files that summarize the raw data;
run visualization scripts on data files to produce plots; and to
parse and combine text files and plots to create papers.
